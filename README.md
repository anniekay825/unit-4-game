# unit-4-game

Purpose of game is to select jewels to match the random number by the computer.

Wins = your guesses match the computer number
Loss = your guess does not match the computer number

Once you have reached either winning or losing the round, the game starts over with a new guess.  Note that the jewel values change each round as well - so you need to continue guessing to win!

Opted to use images of quartz rather than jewels as the files were huge and just make it complicated.  After all, jewels are pretty awesome, so i'm ok with them being complicated.
